# this is python code example that shows the usage of tuple.
# tuples is also same as list in python but with a difference in feature called immuatability
# tuples is immutable because you cannot change the tuple items later once it is defined, where as in list you can reassign the lis item
# values. Also for tuples there are not many methods availables to use. Tuples can be used in python code when where we have to make sure
# the value are not changing. E.g : Calender

# how to declare a tuple

t = (1,2,3)
print(t)

t=('one',2,3.5)      # like list tuple can also have variety of data types in it.
print(t)

#indexing and slicing. This is simillar to what we do in list

print(t[-1])
print(t[1:])
