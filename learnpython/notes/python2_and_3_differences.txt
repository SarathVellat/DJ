Difference between python 2 and 3

- Python 3 - Print is a function by default
- Python 3 - Performs classic division by default
- Python 2 - range() in python stores the values as list and stores the in memory, so we use xrange() which is a generator which yield through the range and gives the values, but never stores in memory, where as in Python 3 range() itself act as a generator.
- Python 2 - range type is list, where as xrange type is xrange itself which is a generator.
- Python 2.x use ASCII encoding by default where as Python 3.x uses utf-8 encoding
